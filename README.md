# Web-Scrapping

Android Application that scraps information from website using Jsoup package.


Using the Jsoup package this Android application scraps information from a provided webpage. The contents of the webpage which are scrapped are stored inside in a string so the user can split the string using Java String functions to display the contents he/she needs. The Jsoup package can be added to Android studio by adding " implementation 'org.jsoup:jsoup:1.11.3' " inside dependencies in app level gradle file.
